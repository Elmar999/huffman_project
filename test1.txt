Huffman is one of the compression algorithms. It is the most famous algorithm to compress text. There are four phases in the Huffman algorithm to compress text. The first is to group the characters. The second is to build the Huffman tree. The third is the encoding, and the last one is the construction of coded bits. The Huffman algorithm principle is the character that often appears on encoding with a series of short bits and characters that rarely appeared in bit-encoding with a longer series. Huffman compression technique can provide savings of 30% from the original bits. It works based on the frequency of characters. The more the similar character reached, the higher the compression rate gained.
